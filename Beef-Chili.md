STAGE NEGATIVE ONE: STOCK
=========================

You can use a store bought (decent) stock if you want. Maybe a chicken one or a veggie one. If you're ambitious, make
your own. If you *do* make your own, it gives you the opportunity to throw whole chipotle peppers (smoked, dried
jalapenos) in there that you'll extract the flavor from before straining out.

Also if you have some on hand or are feeling extra fancy, you can take some smoky scotch whisky or some tequila or some
beer (make it a lager, not an ale) and infuse some chopped habanero or jalapeno (depends on how spicy you like it) for
later. The whisky is great cause it'll add smoke. Smoke is good. The tequila is great because olé! And beer is beer.
You'll throw this in at the last stage, when everything is stewing.

STAGE ZERO: BEANS
=================

So competition chili doesn't even include beans. Personally, I like beans, but they're not the main body of any chili I
make, not even my vegan chili. I am usually lazy and buy cans of red kidney beans and sometimes black beans too. I
usually use maybe two cans of kidney beans and one of black beans. I drain and rinse them thoroughly. They go in at the
end.

If you are enterprising, you can soak dried beans overnight, possibly in beer, and cook them in slightly salted water,
then drain them and treat them as though they came from a can. I've never actually *cooked* the beans with the chili
though. I've always done it separately. That might just be me being a savage.

Notice how I'm not giving you any quantities? Good luck with that.

STAGE ONE: CARAMELIZED ONIONS
=============================

You can do this days in advance and just refrigerate the cooked onions. It takes time, so I usually do it that way.

Caramelize a lot of diced onion (900g/2lbs worth) in coconut oil. You can use clarified butter (ghee) or bacon fat or
duck or goose fat as well. All of them work well. If you don't want any of those, use a normal vegetable oil, but I like
the fat to have some of its own flavor as well. Red or white or yellow onions ... for this recipe, it doesn't make a big
difference.

It's okay if they seem to be cooking in their own juices at first. Caramelization is going to be slow and steady, not a
race. Stir frequently because burnt onions won't taste good. Some people add sugar to the onions to speed up the
process. We will not. Expect to spend about an hour doing this.

Let them get very, very dark. As more of the water evaporates, lower the temperature. Season with salt when most of the
moisture appears to be gone in order to draw out the rest. This is one of the few cases where we don't care if the
onions get a bit mushy. They're going to dissolve in the chili anyway, so we just need to make sure they are uniformly
caramelized, dark-brown and delicious.

As the onions reduce and get darker there is a real danger of burning. If you don't hear a slight sizzle, they are
burning. Be careful, you don't want to start over, do you?

Don't worry too much about other seasoning because the onions will completely integrate into the chili, so the spice
mixture in the later stages will fully permeate them.

The onions are one of the secret weapons of our chili. They're going to give it a full body and richness. Caramelization
accentuates the sweetness of onions and if you used coconut oil, its aroma reinforces that sweetness. If you used bacon
or duck or goose or something crazy like that, it'll add a nice richness and depth. One of the main benefits of the
onions is that they will counterbalance the heat of the spices.

STAGE TWO: VEGETABLES
=====================

There are loads of chili recipes that don't really call for any vegetables except for chile peppers. This is not one of
them. Because I like mushrooms very much, that's why. So here's the deal with mushrooms. They aren't great unless
they're cooked properly.

Mushrooms like fresh shitake with meaty texture are great. But you can use normal white or chestnut mushrooms. Fry them
until they have given off almost all of their moisture. The thing that detracts from a lot of mushroom dishes is
blandness, but if you cook them down, it concentrates their natural flavor and gives them space to absorb the juices
from everything else. *After* your mushrooms are cooked (you should add salt to them to hasten the moisture reduction
and black pepper because black pepper), then add in your fresh sliced peppers. You can use any variety of peppers you
like. Here are my guidelines; they are simple:

1. Remove the seeds from all of the peppers
1. The hotter a pepper is, the smaller your slices should be. Cut bell peppers into chunks; slice jalapenos into
    slivers; dice habaneros very finely. Godspeed.

In terms of volume for the finished vegetables, make it maybe slightly less than your quantity of meat. The main body of
beef chili is beef, after all. But that gives you a rough idea of how much to use.

STAGE THREE: BROWN YOUR MEAT
============================

You need to make a decision: minced beef or cubed chunks? The safer option is minced meat, you won't have to worry too
much about it getting too tough. If you pick a mince meat and you have choices, pick one that has more fat, don't go
ultra lean. If you go with cubes, make them fairly small, like 1.5 cubic cm. I usually get lazy and go with minced.
After you're done with the onions, take them out of your pot, you can leave whatever fat you had in there before, but
remove the onions. Then over high heat just brown your meat. You might need to add a little fat. You don't need to cook
it. You just want to create a little bit of brown crust on it. This is called the
[Maillard reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction). It is what makes everything delicious. It's a sort
of caramelization.

Fun fact: humans slowly cook as they age. I could tell you how they know this, but it's gross and not chili.

*After* your meat has been browned, it's time to add your spices and everything else. Now would be a good time to add
some salt to the beef. Which brings us to...

STAGE FOUR: CHILI POWDER
========================

Okay. Chili powder. This isn't *really* stage four. It could have been done days in advance. This stuff is magic. Do you
have a mortar and pestle? If you don't, get powdered stuff or be prepared to have deliciously smelly hands. My chili
powder varies, but here are the rough ratios. Some of these are optional, and are labeled accordingly:

1. 4 parts ground Mexican oregano (this is ground into a fine powder, not leaves)
1. 4 parts cumin (if you get them whole, toast them, then grind them it's better, but powder is okay)
1. 4 parts granulated garlic (granulated is different from powdered, you can tell because granulated looks like sand
    while powdered is too fine, if you can only find powder, use it)
1. 1-2 parts cinnamon
1. 1-2 parts cayenne pepper (use more or less depending on how spicy you like it and how many fresh chiles you used)
1. 1-2 parts ground chipotle peppers (optional, but totally awesome)
1. 1 part sweet paprika (optional, you can use more if you like)
1. 1 part smoked paprika (optional but smoke is good, remember?)
1. 1 parts hot paprika (optional)
1. 1 part cocoa powder (optional)
1. 1 part ground grains of paradise (definitely optional and a bit unorthodox)

STAGE FIVE: COME TOGETHER
=========================

Okay, so if we're sticking to the plot, you probably have a pot full of browned beef about now. Now is a good time to
add a bunch of crushed garlic in there and just let it soften a bit over medium heat with your beef.

Add all of your cooked mushrooms and peppers and salt. You probably don't need to add too much salt since you were
adding it to some of your components so far, but don't be stingy with it, either.

Now add all of your chili powder. Mix it thoroughly so everything is coated. This is the main base of your chili. At
this point, you can add honey or maple syrup or brown sugar if you like. But don’t go nuts. Some sweetness is nice. But
you don’t make friends with sweet chili.

Finally, add the caramelized onions, the beans, and the stock. Add enough stock to bring the liquid level to maybe a
centimeter above your ingredients. Cook this mixture over low heat. As it reduces, you may want to add some stock to it.
Make sure to stir it occasionally so nothing sticks and so the flavors mix. You can simmer this for between four and
twenty-four hours. Just never let it get too dry. Also, don't *keep* topping it up with stock, you should switch to
water at some point so that it won't just taste like stock.

Remember that tequila/whisky/beer mixture? Either drink it like a champ, or throw it in now.
