STAGE ONE: STARTING INFUSIONS
=============================

Start with high proof neutral spirits. Everclear is perfect for this. In each case you want a fairly substantial amount
of the flavoring agent. Prepare the infusions by adding your spice to your alcohol in roughly these ratios. Store them
for maybe a month

1 cup dried grated coconut for one liter of alcohol. I've had mixed feelings about this. Doesn't taste too coconutty.

30 or so cardamom pods broken open and bruised a bit in a mortar and pestle for one liter. Don't worry about too much
cardamom. There's no such thing.

3-5 vanilla pods sliced open with seeds scraped into the alcohol. This is gonna be very vanilla, add the pod itself too.
It'll make the color of your infusion brownish. But you'll know you did it right because it'll be magic in stage two.

A small tin of saffron. 0.5-1 grams, maybe? A little goes a long way. But it's such a good flavor, I don't skimp on it.

STAGE TWO: BOTTLING INFUSIONS
=============================

Everclear is 95% alcohol. Strain your infusions either through coffee filters or cheesecloth (the saffron is definitely
gonna stain, you probably won't be re-using that cloth). Then add water in equal measure to alcohol. You'll end up with
something around 95 proof. You can up the water a bit if you like, but you won't be drinking these straight so it
doesn't matter much.

The vanilla compounds will fall out of solution when they combine with water and your clear infusion will become very
cloudy. This happens with a lot of liqueurs, most famously with absinthe (it's called the
[louche effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouzo_effect) with absinthe).

THE COCKTAIL
============

1. Cardamom infusion (2 parts)
1. Vanilla infusion (1 part)
1. Coconut infusion (1 part -- optional, feel free to double vanilla instead)
1. Saffron infusion (1-2 parts -- depends on your preference)
1. Coconut milk or dairy cream (2 parts)
1. Simple syrup (2 parts -- sweeter if you like)
1. Egg whites (1 part -- optional, I only find it's necessary when sweetening with sucralose,
    since you lose the mouthfeel of simple syrup)

If you add the egg whites, put all the ingredients *without* ice into a cocktail shaker and shake vigorously for maybe a
minute.

Fill a shaker with ice and all ingredients. Shake a whole bunch. Strain and pour over ice. Straining is particularly
important if you're using coconut milk. I like giant ice cubes.

Grate some nutmeg and sprinkle some cinnamon on top. Enjoy :)
